### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this application is to track votes and link support for a policy/bill
to the amoount of money politicians earn from lobbysists. The main reasoning for
this is so that constituents can understand the different/possibly conflicting interests
that may be in play when politicians, who should be properly representing their
constituents, vote. This would then create accountability and force transparency. 
If I had more time to expand on this, I would also add which corporations and 
entities politicians receive funding from to better inform the user. 

### Usability Principles Considered



### Organization of Components

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components

### How the User Triggers State Changes
