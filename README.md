### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this application is to track votes and link support for a policy/bill
to the amoount of money politicians earn from lobbysists. The main reasoning for
this is so that constituents can understand the different/possibly conflicting interests
that may be in play when politicians, who should be properly representing their
constituents, vote. This would then create accountability and force transparency. 
If I had more time to expand on this, I would also add which corporations and 
entities politicians receive funding from to better inform the user. 

### Usability Principles Considered
There were a few different ways I approached usability:

When choosing which buttons to use for my filters and sorting, I decided on radio 
buttons to make clear to the user which filter/sort was selected, and signify 
that buttons in the same category could only be selected one at a time. 

I also made sure to use different fonts in my accumulator to differentiate title
items (such as the accumulator title, votes, and funding) and items that are 
actually in the accumulator. I also used sets and different states to ensure that 
the accumulator would have no duplicates, and the vote and funding values would 
properly update. 

I placed a reset accumulator button to make it easier for users to clear the 
votes and funding rather than having to individually remove all the items in 
the accumulator. 

Lastly, I visually separated each card with the gray background to ensure there
was proper hierarchy and politician images and data would be properly 
associated with each other.
